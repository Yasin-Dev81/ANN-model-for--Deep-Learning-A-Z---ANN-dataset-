This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn using the dataset from the **Deep Learning A-Z** course.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is available on Kaggle:
[Deep Learning A-Z ANN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/filippoo/deep-learning-az-ann)

It contains customer information such as credit score, geography, gender, age, balance, and whether they exited the bank or not (churn).

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

* Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**
* Model Type: **Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
* Problem Type: **Binary Classification** (Predicting if a customer exits the bank)

---

## âœ… Features

* Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
* ANN architecture with Keras
* Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
* Predictions on test data

---
