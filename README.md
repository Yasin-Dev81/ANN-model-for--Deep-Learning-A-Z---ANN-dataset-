# ANN Model for (Deep Learning A-Z - ANN Dataset)

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn using the dataset from the **Deep Learning A-Z** course.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is available on Kaggle:
[Deep Learning A-Z ANN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/filippoo/deep-learning-az-ann)

It contains customer information such as credit score, geography, gender, age, balance, and whether they exited the bank or not (churn).
